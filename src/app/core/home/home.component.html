            This quiz is meant to bring a sense of humanity and awareness to the participant. We are all people with different personalities and upbringings. This test is a humorous attempt at showing us how common characteristics in these leaders are also present in ourselves. This makes no seroius conclusions about the state or future of the participant. Hopefully this will bring a sense of humanization of the leader. Not so that we can change our opinion of them but rather see that they were once regular people like us that went down a dark path.
